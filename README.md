# Starhopper 🚀

_This README was generated by AI, then edited by a human._

**Starhopper** is a browser-based retro arcade game where you pilot a spacecraft through the 12 Zodiac constellations to find extraterrestrial life.

Built using Google's **Antigravity** as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an agentic coding course.

## 🎮 How to Play

**Mission:** Connect all stars in each constellation sequence before time runs out. The time limit decreases with each level!

### Controls

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Arrow Keys** | Move Ship |
| **Shift** | Boost Speed (2x) |
| **Z** | Brake / Slow Down (0.5x) |
| **Enter** | Start Game / Continue |

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **HTML5 Canvas**: For high-performance 2D rendering.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**: Core game loop, physics, and state management.
*   **CSS3**: Retro UI overlays and typography.
*   **Firebase**: Configured for easy hosting.

## 🚀 Deployment & Local Development

### Run Locally

Since this is a static site, you can simply open `public/index.html` in your browser.

Or, if you have the Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
firebase serve
```

### Deploy to Firebase

1.  Initialize Firebase (if not already done):
    ```bash
    firebase login
    firebase init
    ```
2.  Deploy:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```

Good luck, and bon voyage!


## Prompt

Below is the entire prompt that the author used to steer Antigravity.

Hi Gemini. I'd like you to implement a game for me in the ag-playground/starhopper directory. The game is called Starhopper. It should have an old-school arcade game feel. Here's how I want it to work:
1. Players always get the same message at the start screen:
------
Astronaut 311-C,

As humanity's best pilot, you have been selected for a crucial, top-secret mission: to find extraterrestrial life.

To do this, you must pilot your spacecraft between the stars of the 12 Zodiac constellations, as they appear. With each new constellation, you will have less time to connect the points. You must connect all of the constellations within the time limit to discover our intergalactic friends.

Use your arrow keys to move the spacecraft. Press **Shift**to speed up and **Z** to slow down.

Good luck, and bon voyage!

[Press **Enter** to continue]

2. That message explains the mechanics pretty well. Players will press enter, and then points, representing stars in one constellation, should appear on-screen. Players have to fly their ship between each point of the constellation, as described. Connections should appear when players take their craft close enough to each dot. And while they play, a timer should appear in a corner on-screen, and count down.

Once players connect all the stars in a given constellation, a new constellation appears. But players will have a little less time to complete each successive constellation. 

3. The game continues until they fail, or win.

3.a If they fail, it should say:

Astronaut 311-A, 

You have failed your mission. Humanity remains alone among the stars. Unless you choose to try again...

[Press **Enter** to restart]

3.b If they succeed, it should say:
------
Dear traveller,

We are the Zargaborgs. Welcome to our world! We are happy to have you here.

I am Zarg 966-Z, and I had to step out to run some errands in Orion's belt. But I'll be back soon! In the meantime, make yourself at home. I left some yarlop juice in the fridge for you.

See you soon!
ZZ
------

The game should use Firebase, for data storage and hosting. I've initialized the directory to support that. But I leave it to you to implement the rest. Start with a plan, and we'll go from there.
